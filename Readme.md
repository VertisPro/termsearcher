##termsearcher - searching for right term in a clinical setting

This project is a quick hack to showcase a method for searching the right term in a healthcare codeset, subset or terminology. 

It provides often missed features in clinical term search interfaces like:
* On the fly spell checking
* Search modifiers in the text box (not look for a term, look for a combination etc)
* Auto-complete 
* Last searched - popular searches

The intention is to help start a conversation around how a clinical documentation system can be integrated with a search system.

Here is what it looks like:

It was build using Go and python and can be scaled to serve 50+ users on a single instance.

Please note that this code is not production ready.
